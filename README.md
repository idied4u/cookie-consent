# 🍪 cookie-consent

> A minimalist, ethical cookie consent component for React + TypeScript.  
> No tracking. Just a clean banner and real user choice — only when you need it.

---

## Features

- ✅ One self-contained `.tsx` file
- ✅ Written in React + TypeScript
- ✅ Stores consent in `localStorage`
- ✅ Includes `useCookieConsent()` hook (in the same file)
- ✅ Only shows banner when needed (custom logic supported)
- ❌ No external dependencies
- ❌ No third-party scripts or trackers

---

## 📦 Installation

This is a standalone component — just copy the single `CookieConsent.tsx` file into your project.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

You may be legally or ethically required to ask for consent if your site uses:

- Google Analytics  
- Facebook Pixel  
- Embedded YouTube, maps, or media  
- Any third-party cookies or local tracking

This component doesn’t track anything. It simply respects your user's agency and gives you a place to ask for consent before loading third-party tools.

## 🛡️ Legal Notice

This component helps you delay scripts or tracking until the user explicitly consents. It’s a step toward compliance with:

- **GDPR** (EU)  
- **CCPA/CPRA** (California)  
- **PECR** (UK)

You are responsible for:

- Disclosing data practices  
- Respecting user choices  
- Ensuring legal compliance for your region
